Django 2 Boilerplate
=====================

A sensible starting point for django based web projects.

What you get out of the box
---

* Pipenv set up
* Django 2 with storages, psycopg2, gunicorn
* Dockerfile for the main django app
* A docker-compose config for development
* Rational, environment specific configuration

More coming...

How do I use it?
